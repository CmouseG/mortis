### description   :Â mortis
An end-to-end(-to-end) solution with everything from mobile app, web app, desktop app,  <br> restapi server, 
update server, to docker, kuberneters, and deployment scripts.

There are several good boilerplate projects out there. <br>
This is gonna be a bit more than a boilerplate. 

This is aimed at building a complete solution and by complete I mean :

 - angular web application
 - ionic mobile application
 - electron desktop application
 - nodejs restapi for serving data to the angular, ionic and electron clients
 - squirrel update server for delivering desktop application updates 
 - mysql | postgres database server in virtual and dockerized formats for primary storage
 - redis server in virtual and dockerized formats for relaying realtime messages
 - docker and kubernetes yml files for local development in minikube 
 - scripts for releasing to gcloud
 - gulp tasks for linting and hinting
 - and later, once it it up and running better, some audio video to explain things better.

Complete. Everything a small development studio could need to start a project <br>
targetting iOS, Android, Windows, OSX, and Linux.   

Build with heavy code re-use, Sass, shared modules, OAuth2 security, iptable driven firewalls,.. <br>all the things.
